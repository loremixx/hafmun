            <h1>CC: <span>FBI</span></h1>
            <p>Disruptive organizations and their extreme movements were operating in the United States in the late 1950s to 1960s. A particular organization was created by George Lincoln Rockwell, which represented an old set of beliefs which embraced anti-Semitism and racial supremacy, with a leader who aspired to be involved in the political arena as a governor or president. Though these movements were always on the outside edges and had very few members, the aggressive vitriol and public acts of provocation garnered significant attention.</p>
            <p>The FBI followed groups like this during this time frame, seeing them as a potentially harmful threat, especially with their militaristic tendencies and access to firearms. This monitoring was one element of that Bureau's larger effort to track and neutralize disruptive and subversive organizations that were active during that timeframe.</p>
            <p>As senior agents for the FBI, it is your responsibility to track and stop the extreme movements of these organizations.</p>
