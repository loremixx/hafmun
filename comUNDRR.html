            <h1>COMMITEE OF <span>F-UNDRR</span></h1>
            <p>The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) was created in December 1999 to ensure the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.</p>
            <p>It's mandate is defined as "to serve as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among the disaster reduction activities of the United Nations system and regional organizations and activities in socio-economic and humanitarian fields"</p>
            <p>In the committee, delegates will first discuss how to reduce the impact of the most feared Istanbul Earthquake on the North Anatolian Fault Line  and will write a final document regarding their resolutions in a quick fashion. The resolutions that have been implemented will change how intense the Istanbul Earthquake in the "future" will be. Will the delegates be able to reduce the intensity to favorable levels, or will they need to act quickly against a global level crisis resulted mostly due to preparational issues?</p>
            <h2>Agenda Item: Background and Aftermath of the Great Istanbul Earthquake</h2>
            <h2>Under Secretary-General: Kuzey Karlık</h2>
